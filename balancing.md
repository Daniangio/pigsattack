Balancing idea: add lightweight telemetry during bot sims (e.g., average resources gained/spent per stance, win rate per stance choice, distribution of token picks) and replay logs to see which actions drive score jumps. You can also temporarily buff/nerf stance resource outputs in a config and compare resulting state scores or win rates across a batch of offline simulations to spot overpowered options.
