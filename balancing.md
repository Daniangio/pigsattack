This is a necessary but dangerous starting point. While I agree that establishing a baseline is critical, your "No-Buy" hypothesis has a fatal flaw if used as the primary calibration tool.

The Critique: The "Zero-Utility" Fallacy
If you balance threats based on a "No-Buy" simulation (Base Production + Base Attacks), you are calibrating the game for a player who is failing to play.

If a player using only base production can "survive" or "compete" against the threats, your economy is irrelevant. Why would a player buy a weapon if the base production is sufficient to clear the board?

The Correct Hypothesis: In a "No-Buy" simulation, the players should lose catastrophically.

Wound Velocity: They should reach the high Wound Cap by the end of the Day Era/first turns of Night Era.

Threat Saturation: The board should be full soon.

You are not calibrating for "Balance" here; you are calibrating for Doom. This establishes the Pressure Floor.

The Iterative V-Model for Balancing
You cannot balance Threats and Market sequentially. They are coupled variables in a dynamic system. I propose a V-Model approach:

Decomposition (The Doom Run): Calibrate Threats to kill a "naked" player.

Implementation (The Solvency Run): Calibrate Upgrades to provide just enough resources to survive the Doom Run.

Integration (The Efficiency Run): Calibrate Weapons to convert those resources into VP more efficiently than raw spending.

Here is how to automate this specifically for Wild Pigs Will Attack!.
