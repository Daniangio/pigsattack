3️⃣ STANCES — WHO ARE YOU?

Your weakness (which pig type hurts you)


Stance
Start Resources
Weak vs
Style
Aggressive
4R / 0B / 1G
Feral
Strike first, risk wounds
Tactical
1R / 4B / 0G
Cunning
Efficient, opportunistic
Hunkered
0R / 1B / 4G
Massive
Late power, early stall
Balanced
2R / 2B / 2G
ANY**
Versatile but fragile

**Balanced: Not attacked by Hybrid threats, which instead attack other stances with the attack corresponding to stance.
Re-Stance Action
Spend your main action to change stance to any other.

4️⃣ THREAT BOARD
Number of lanes = N_players
 Each lane displays 3 visible threats:
Front  —  Mid  —  Back  — (Deck)

Threats stay in their row until defeated or advanced.

5️⃣ THREAT TYPES & ATTACKS
Threat cost examples: 8R + 2B + 0G
Attack logic (after each player turn)
If your stance is weak to that type → you suffer:
Type
Icon
Attack Effect
Feral
🟥
1 Wound 💀
Cunning
🟦
Steal 2 resources; if none → 1 Wound
Massive
🟩
If 3+ Weight tokens → 1 Wound
Hybrid
🟨
Apply effect matching your stance weakness. If Hunkered → also gain +1 Weight and deal 1 Wound independently of how many Weight tokens

Hybrids do not attack Balanced directly.
 If you are weak → they strike like the pig type you fear.

6️⃣ TURN & ROUND STRUCTURE
Start of Turn
Produce resources from stance


Gain per-round upgrade bonuses


Take ONE Main Action:
1️⃣ Fight a threat
2️⃣ Extend a Slot
3️⃣ Re-Stance
4️⃣ Prepare (choose a token among ferocity, conversion or wild and add to your board). Token limit is always 3 per type.

Optional Buy (once per turn, anytime)
Buy 1 Upgrade OR 1 Weapon
 (must pay cost and have free slot)
End of Turn: Threat Attack
Weight Growth: Massive in Front row gain +1 Weight token
Then, each Front threat that matches your stance weakness triggers its attack.

7️⃣ END OF ROUND — THREAT ADVANCE
After all players have played once:
1️⃣ Advance
Mid → Front if empty


Back → Mid if empty


2️⃣ Spawn
 Fill each empty Back with new threats
3️⃣ Initiative rotates counter-clockwise
 (last player becomes first, effectively playing two turns consecutively)

8️⃣ COMBAT
You may fight the frontmost visible threat in any lane
 (even if positioned as Mid/Back)
You may use:
Resources (R/B/G)


Weapon discount effects


Wild conversions


Ferocity Tokens −2R once


Mass Tokens −2G permanently


On success:
Remove threat from threats zone and add to your trophies zone. Some threats may have an effect that you can activate by consuming them from your trophies zone.
Gain printed VP (scored at game end, do not gain VP tokens)
Gain Spoils (tokens / abilities)



9️⃣ UPGRADES & WEAPONS
Upgrades = permanent boosts
Weapons = limited-use power plays
Must place in respective slot
Max 4 each after slot extensions


Example upgrade types:
Resource production
Permanent discounts
Token generation
Snipe access


Example weapon types:
Cost reductions
Conversion tricks
One-shot boss damage



🔟 BOSSES — ERA CLIMAX
Boss revealed at start of each Era
(1 for Day, 1 for Night)
Boss appears when:
Threat deck is empty AND
No threats in Front row
Boss card:
Contains multiple threshold zones, each with its cost (R+B+G), its spoil for paying that threshold cost and its penalty for not being able to pay.
Boss Fight Phase (simultaneous)
Each player chooses any thresholds and pays their cost:
For each threshold:
Pay → gain Boss reward
Skip → suffer Boss penalty (e.g. wounds, resource loss)


Boss has no lanes, no positioning, no scaling.
After Day Boss → reset lanes with Night Threat Deck
After Night Boss → Game End

1️⃣1️⃣ WOUNDS — VP Penalties
1 Wound = −1 VP


5+ Wounds = −10 VP total


You can still have >5 wounds — but never lose more than 10 VP.

1️⃣2️⃣ THREAT DECK SIZE
Total threats = N_players × 4 per Era × 2 Eras
 Good pacing, consistent tension.
