🐗 WILD PIGS WILL ATTACK! — RULEBOOK v3.0
A tactical, resource-driven survival game for 1–5 players.
This version uses the stance economy, resource-based combat, three token types, upgrades/weapons with VP, and three-row threat armies with Era Bosses.

1. GAME OVERVIEW
The world has fallen to mutated boars whose Ferocity (R), Cunning (B), and Mass (G) threaten the last survivors.
 Each player builds a personal engine using stances, upgrades, weapons, and tokens, then fights through two armies—Day and Night—each culminating in a Boss with layered damage thresholds.
Players generate resources each round depending on their stance, use them to defeat threats, upgrade their character, extend slots, or reposition strategically.
The winner is the survivor with the most Victory Points (VP) from threats, upgrades, boss tokens, and bonuses.

3. STANCES & RESOURCE ENGINE
Stances determine:
Resources generated at the start of your turn
A discount applied to the next fight
Players may change stance using actions (see Actions section).

Stances Table
Stance     Start-of-round  Production Fight Discount
Aggressive 4R / 0B / 1G    Reduce R cost by 1
Tactical   1R / 3B / 1G    Reduce B cost by 1
Hunkered   0R / 1B / 4G    Reduce G cost by 1
Balanced   2R / 2B / 1G    Reduce any ONE stat by 1

Stance Movement Rule
You may always move one step between adjacent stances (Agg ↔ Bal ↔ Tac ↔ Bal ↔ Hunk ↔ Bal).
To switch between corner stances (Agg ↔ Tac, Tac ↔ Hunk, Hunk ↔ Agg) you must pass through Balanced unless you use the Realign action.

4. TOKENS (Core Temporary Mechanics)
Attack Token
One use
Gives +2 Red resources for a single fight
Great for Feral threats or boss spikes

Conversion Token
Convert up to 2 resources of a single color into another color
Use anytime
Blue-build speciality

Mass Token
Permanent effect
Reduces all Mass (G) costs by −2
Extremely rare and powerful
From Massive threats or Green upgrades

Wild Token
One use
Provides +1 resource of ANY color
Smooths awkward cost requirements

Token Limits:
Players may hold no more than 3 of a given token type.

5. GAME SETUP
Give each player:
A dashboard
A stance marker (start in Balanced)
1 upgrade slot, 1 weapon slot (both can be extended up to 4)

Shuffle:
Day Threat Deck
Night Threat Deck
Upgrades Deck
Weapons Deck
Boss Deck (2 bosses: Day Boss, Night Boss)

Build the Day Army:
Three rows of 4 threats each (for a standard game)
Reveal the Day Boss beside them
Place Night Army & Night Boss aside for later.
Decide first player using any method.

6. ROUND STRUCTURE
Each round, players take turns clockwise.
a. Start-of-Round Phase
Each player:
Produces resources from their stance
Gains any per-round upgrade income
Tokens and unspent resources DO NOT expire unless a card says so.

b. Player Turn (Choose ONE Action)
ACTION A — Fight a Threat
You may fight a threat only if you can fully pay its cost using:
Resources from production
Tokens
Weapon effects
Mass token reductions
Stance discount (−1)

You may only attack:
The front threat in any of the three rows
Second-row threats only if a weapon/ability allows (e.g., Snipe Scope)

If defeated:
Gain VP equal to threat’s VP value
Gain its spoil reward (token or consumable)
Move it from the row to your spoils zone. If a threat has a "CONSUME:" ability,
you can consume it any time to activate its effect (discard from spoils zone after resolving effect).
Slide the column downward to align first threat of that column
to first threats of other columns

ACTION B — Buy an Upgrade
Pay the upgrade cost in resources.
Place it in an available Upgrade Slot.
Upgrades grant VP when purchased and permanent effects.
If no slots are available, this action cannot be performed.

ACTION C — Extend a Slot
Choose either:
+1 Upgrade Slot OR
+1 Weapon Slot

Then gain 1 Wild Token.
Max slots: 4 each.
If you have maxed all slots, this action cannot be performed.

ACTION D — Realign
Move your stance to ANY stance, bypassing movement rules.
Gain 1 Wild Token.
This action is your tempo reset and strategic repositioning tool.
If you are in a stance from which you can move to any other stance in one step
(i.e., following the rules), you cannot perform this action.

ACTION E - Scavenge
Gain 1 Wild Token

c. End turn
Turn passes to next player clockwise.
When all players played a turn in a round, initiative token moves counter-clockwise.
This means that the last player in first round becomes the first player in next round
(effectively playing two turns in a row).

7. THREATS & SPOILS
Every threat has:
A cost vector (e.g., 6R + 2B or 5G + 1R)
A type (Feral, Cunning, Massive, or Hybrid)
A VP reward
A spoil reward (token or consumable ability)

Examples of Spoils
Attack Token
Conversion Token
Mass Token (rare)
Weapon Discount (Consume this card: reduce weapon cost by 2”)
Snipe Consumable (“Consume: attack a second-row threat”)
Next Turn Bonus (“Next Round: Discount 1B in fights”)

Day threats: cost 6–12
Night threats: cost 10–18

8. UPGRADES
Upgrades provide:
Permanent resource bonuses
Token generation
Combat discounts
Stance-dependent boosts
VP on purchase

See the CSV for full reference.
Examples:
Ferocity Modulator: +1R per turn
Precision Optics: Reduce highest stat by 1 in fights
Mass Core: +2G per turn
Catalyst Array: Convert Wild → Conversion
Versatility Module: +2 Wild tokens per round
Upgrades must be placed in slots; slot extensions allow more upgrades.

9. WEAPONS
Weapons offer:
Limited-use or permanent stat reductions
Snipe effects
Conversion effects
Combat manipulation

Placed in weapon slots.
Examples:
Shockblade: 3 uses, −3R cost per attack
Thermal Lance: 1 use, −3 cost to all stats
Snipe Scope: -2B cost and attack second-row
Phase Gauntlet: Convert 1 resource freely each round

10. BOSSES & ERA END
Each Era ends with a Boss Fight Phase.
Every Boss card shows multiple thresholds.
Each threshold has:
A resource cost
Matching rewards (Boss tokens, one-use attack cards, slot extensions, VP bonus)
Players independently attempt any one threshold per Era.
Boss is not shared—each player fights their own attempt.
Rewards stack across Eras.

11. VICTORY CONDITIONS
At the end of the Night Boss Phase, totally:
VP from Threats
VP from Upgrades
VP from Boss Tokens
Bonus VP from items or special awards

Highest total wins.
Ties:
Most Night Threats defeated
Most Mass tokens
Most remaining resources

12. EXAMPLES
Example Fight
You are in Tactical Stance.
 Production: 1R, 3B, 1G.
 Discount: −1B.
You attack a threat costing 2R + 5B + 1G.
Modified cost:
2R
(5B − 1B = 4B)
1G


You spend:
1R (production) + 1R from pool
3B production + 1B from Wild token
1G from production

Threat defeated → gain its spoil.

Example Realign Turn
You need Green next turn.
You use Realign:
Switch to Hunkered
Gain 1 Wild token
 No threat fought this turn.

Next round you produce 0R,1B,4G and get −1G discount.

Example Mixed Build
You have:
Precision Optics (−1 to highest stat)
Catalyst Array (Wild → Conversion)
Impact Maul (−1G)
2 Mass Tokens (−4G total)

Now a Night threat of 10G + 2R effectively costs:
10G − 4G (Mass tokens) − 1G (Maul) = 5G
2R

Very manageable with two Wild tokens and stance production.
